        <h2>Why NMD?</h2>
        <p>I haven't been able to get a job in Sweden even though I have a university degree and 10+ years of experience in my field. I thought it was due to a language barrier.
            But, according to SVT, swedes are very racist and they published an article saying that immigrants from my region take in average 6 years to find a job in their profession.
        Also, a study from Lund University shows bias against immigrants: the researchers submitted identical assignments to be graded under different names, and found out that "Greta" would get a higher grade than "Ahmed" for the same paper.
    Furthermore, they elected a Sweden Democrat government on the last elections. I know that IT is probably the only sector where my level of swedish would not matter, but I am starting to think that it might not be enough for me to get a job.</p>
        <br />
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I play piano and cello, mostly romantic music: Chopin, Liszt Schumann, Brahms, Rachmaninoff and Scriabin.
 I also read a lot. Before I turned 18 I had already read the complete works of William Shakespeare, Jorge Luis Borges, Sigmund Freud and Franz Kafka.
 My favorite books are The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus by Ludwig Wittgenstein and Fictions by Jorge Luis Borges.
